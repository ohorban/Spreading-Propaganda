# CS40 Homework3: Spreading Propaganda
 Reddit bot spreading political propaganda for 2020 presidential election

 **Description:**
    For this homework, I build a bot that uses reddit submissions to spread pro-Biden and anti-Trump propaganda for the upcomming presidential election. The bot also generates the tex based on some key words of the sentence. <br />

    I personally like [this comment interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/csci040temp/comments/jl9yrq/biden_leads_by_10_points_as_majority_of_americans/gantsbi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the cutest, because all comments are pro-Biden and my bot decided to have some fun with "aliens" , "Daddy Biden" and "supreme ruler of America"
